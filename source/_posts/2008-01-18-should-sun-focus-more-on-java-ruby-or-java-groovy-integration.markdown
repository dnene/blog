Rick Hightower presents an argument to encourage sun to support groovy rather than ruby ("Quit pimple pimping ruby":http://www.jroller.com/RickHigh/entry/thanks_zed_btw_syntax_matters)

> Can we just get some decent support for Groovy? No instead Sun invests in Ruby via JRuby. DOH! Groovy looks a lot like Java. It is much easier to get started with it. The syntax does not make developers want to hurl. Why is Sun investing so much money in JRuby?  
  
The investment should be in Groovy. Developers who know Java can learn Groovy quickly and are more likely to do so if the tools support it. Ruby is a non-starter.

One of the arguments based on a chart similar (not the same) to the one below is :

> Here is another reason not to invest heavily in Ruby. For the color blind: RUBY COMES IN DEAD LAST!   
  
Ruby comes in dead last. If there was going to be a revolution, it would have happened already. Ruby is a little long in the tooth to finish this poorly. Don't you think?

When I represent the chart in relative terms (ie. percentage growth from a common starting point) it seems suddenly obvious that both ruby and groovy have a sufficiently strong momentum. Here's the modified chart based on a relative scale

If one instead takes a look at the [TIOBE Programming Community Index](http://www.tiobe.com/tpci.htm) , Ruby shows up at the 11th Rank whereas Groovy still at 31st(at the point in time of writing this post). Incidentally the top 10 languages trend shows up as follows

If I was Sun and had ample $$ to spare, I would attempt to support both, and if I had to choose, I would go for better java integration with Ruby using JRuby rather than focusing on Groovy. 
(But then neither am I sun neither I have so many $$ to spare :( )
