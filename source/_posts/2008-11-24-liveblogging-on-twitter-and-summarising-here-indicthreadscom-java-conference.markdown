Shall be live blogging from the IndicThreads.com Java Conference on twitter, and shall be posting a daily summary here. After much consideration, decided twitter was a much better option for liveblogging (wordpress just doesn't seem like the right tool to liveblog :( ). I shall be twittering on [dnene_liveblog](http://twitter.com/dnene_liveblog) (Thats not my usual twitter account which is : [dnene](http://twitter.com/dnene)). Hope to be able to post a summary of the day each evening on this blog as well. Here's the [conference schedule](http://conference.indicthreads.com/content/view/62/75/) to whet your interest.
