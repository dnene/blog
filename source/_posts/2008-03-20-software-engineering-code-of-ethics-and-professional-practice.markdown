It has not been rare to come across situations where loyalties to one's profession and to the organisation one is working for may end up "_seeming_" at odds. On rare occasions, I have run into advice or opinions which sometimes were either questionable at best or unethical at worst. While I used my common sense, what was missing for me was a clear and present reference which helps evaluate a particular situation from professional ethics perspective. Came across a document which can help act as such a reference for the software engineering community and thought it was just too good to miss blogging about.

Here's the document : [Software Engineering Code of Ethics and Professional Practice](http://www.acm.org/about/se-code).

In the sometimes cynical and less than innocent world we find ourselves in - this is refreshing content. Perhaps good material for people to read when they enter the workforce and review every time they take on a new assignment or maybe once every six months. Wonder how much is it subject to [moral relativism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_relativism).
