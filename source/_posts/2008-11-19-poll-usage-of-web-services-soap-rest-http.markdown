While the web service meme and implementations has been out there for many years, statistics about how many developers publish or consume them are a little hard to come by. Many statistics talk about the % organisations which have adopted or intend to adopt SOA / Web Services etc., but these often are less than sufficiently usefulÂ  IMHO since it does not indicate how widely these get used.

This poll attempts to understand **how many developers "actually" either publish or consume web services in the current projects that they are involved with**, and if so, what is the nature of the web service APIs (SOAP / REST / HTTP-POX).

Please note, that the poll is in the top right widget of this blog. Multiple selections are acceptable. **If this is an answer you seek as well, please invite other developers you know to participate as well through email and blog posts** Just indicate to them that the poll can be found in the top right widget at [http://blog.dhananjaynene.com](http://blog.dhananjaynene.com). While you can follow the current results online as entries are added, the poll will close on November 30th when the final results will be published.

**Update :**

Due to apparent lack of interest (no votes for the last 3 days), I am closing this poll early. The final summary of the votes is as follows :



	
  * **_Publishing with REST (57%, 12 Votes)_**

	
  * **_Consuming / Using REST services (57%, 12 Votes)_**

	
  * Consuming / Using SOAP services (29%, 6 Votes)

	
  * Publishing with SOAP (24%, 5 Votes)

	
  * Publishing non SOAP / non REST HTTP services (24%, 5 Votes)

	
  * Consuming non SOAP / non REST HTTP services (14%, 3 Votes)

	
  * No web services being published or consumed (5%, 1 Votes)




Total Voters: **21**
