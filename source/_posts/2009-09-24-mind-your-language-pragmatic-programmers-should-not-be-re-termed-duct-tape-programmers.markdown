[The Duct Tape Programmer](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2009/09/23.html) by Joel Spolsky makes for an interesting reading. However it suffers from one issue. A big issue. It attempts to take terms with a particular well associated meaning with it, assign it to something else which already has a better available term and in the process creates one big ball of confusion.

In my understanding which hasn't changed for many years - a duct tape programmer is a programmer who always takes the shortest route from point A to point B without giving regards to longetivity or maintainability of the solution. When he applies a duct tape - he is ticking off a job as "done". He has not accounted for how long will the solution last. Is it even the right solution or is it just something that on the face of things seems right. He is only pragmatic enough to make sure he can get home early or be in his bosses good books. Thats where his pragmatism ends. Thats why the term has a negative meaning. Thats why it is not meant to be a compliment.

Now what happens when you associate it in the way Joel just did in his blog post ? Suddenly it no longer seems to be a negative term. It gives rise to confusion. If someone now calls me a duct tape programmer - I'll be tempted to take it as a compliment. On the other hand - when someone writes a shitty crappy piece of code - I now have to figure out a new term - since I can no longer term it duct tape programming. I mean if I do and he responds a link to the post - what chance would I stand compared to someone as esteemed as Joel. 

I understand as bloggers we want to make a point. I also understand that there are ways to make the point in a manner that really really stands out. But at times there are risks and negative consequences when we go down that path. These include confusing the juniors, the post getting misunderstood, misconstrued or even misquoted. These also include possible positive spin on essentially negative characteristics. Lets stick to calling pragmatic programmers as pragmatic programmers and leave duct tape programming to the realm of the essentially short sighted, fragile and often brittle programming that it really stands for.
