Am pre-announcing a blog post I intend to publish on Monday January 26th, 2009. Top 5 software / IT terms that are ripe for abuse. The four that immediately come to mind are REST, Cloud, Mashup and *AAS (saas, paas, maas etc.). I am opening up nominations for the 5th term. Please nominate your term along with rationale in comments below.

Abuse refers to the overuse of a word and implying it with too many different attributes in different contexts, so that eventually the same word can no longer be used without providing a lot of qualifications about "this is what I mean when I say .....". Examples from past are n tier architecture, SOA etc.
