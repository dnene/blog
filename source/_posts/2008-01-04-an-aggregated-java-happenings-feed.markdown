Looking over at "Yahoo Pipes!":http://pipes.yahoo.com/ , I had a curious idea. Could I use it to create one composite feed of a variety of rss feeds that I use today ? I created an as yet simple composite feed comprising of "On Java":http://www.onjava.com, "IBM Developerworks - Java":http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java , "TheServerside.com":http://www.theserverside.com and "Java Blogs Hot Entries":http://www.javablogs.com/ViewHotBlogEntries.action . I selected the first 10 items from the first three and 20 from the java blogs. 

These are a couple of views on the same pipe.

* "Stay Current With Java - RSS":http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.run?_id=gATh5rq63BGUfHPtJphxuA&_render=rss  
* "Stay Current With Java - Yahoo Pipes Page":http://pipes.yahoo.com/dhananjaynene/staycurrentwithjava . 

The feed has currently 50 items and I would like to roughly stick with that number - just so that thats a feed that I can review once when I start the day and perhaps once when I end it. 

*_Would you have any suggestions in terms of either the content providers or the filters one can use to make the feed more useful ?_*
