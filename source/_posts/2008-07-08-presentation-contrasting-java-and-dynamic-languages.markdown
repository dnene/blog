I presented this last week at the [Session @ Java Meet](http://www.indicthreads.com/articles/1250/java_php_ruby_groovy_jython_python.html) organised by [IndicThreads](http://www.indicthreads.com/). Have attempted to look at the contrast from the points of view of developers, architects and managers.
