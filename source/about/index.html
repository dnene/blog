Passionate about programming, design, architecture and all that comes under the umbrella of software engineering.  Have worked on providing solutions to a number of diverse problems including building cash management and foreign currency remittance products, applications for telecom access management, interactive educational software for pre teen children, building administration suites for workflow authoring applications, creating applications that compute electromagnetic wave signal strengths for computing wifi reach, and building frameworks and applications which process in excess of a million financial transactions per hour.  Along the way I have switched across a number of roles including those of a developer, chief architect, chief technology officer and head of product development. My education includes a B.E. (Mechanical Engineering) from M. S. University of Baroda, and an M.B.A. from Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad.
