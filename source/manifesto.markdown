**Objective :** This blog is setup to help share my thoughts and opinions primarily in the field of Software Engineering with its readers. 

I undertake to use the following guidelines to help select and publish the content I consider relevant and useful for its readers.




	
  * **Original Thought : ** Even though a post may use information liberally from a number of other diverse sources, it shall also contain some thought, opinion, analysis that I contribute within the context. I shall generally avoid activities such as simple links to other pages, aggregation of external content except in extreme circumstances where I believe the same is still likely to be substantially useful to the readers and they are less likely to find similar information elsewhere easily.
  

	
  * **Separate Opinion and Conjecture from Analysis : ** I shall present either the thoughts and/or the analysis in a reasoned fashion or clearly identify the content as an opinion or a conjecture as relevant.
  

	
  * **Balanced :** I shall in general attempt to present as balanced or unbiased a view as I reasonably can without deliberately attempting to promote or  denigrate any other software views, tools, frameworks, libraries etc.
  

	
  * **Indicate promotional interests:**If and when I use the blog to promote a particular view or a software artifact, (eg. things that I author, contribute to or am otherwise substantially interested in increasing adoption of), I shall clearly indicate my inclination so that readers are better able to understand and appropriately interpret the content I present. This expression shall be made with the statement "I promote [comma separated list of software artifacts]" mentioned clearly in the sidebar or footer and in this manifesto.
  

	
  * **Maintain Respect : **Even in situations where I may find myself wanting to be strongly critical of the views or software artifacts authored by a person or organisation, I shall while clearly expressing such views, maintain a respectful note towards the said person or organisation. 
  

	
  * **Attribution :** I shall acknowledge and attribute all relevant external sources of information whenever I can. In case I am unable to recollect the source, I shall still acknowledge the existence of an external source of information.
  

	
  * **Identify future updates : **Except for syntactic or grammatical or otherwise trivial corrections, I shall identify all future changes to a post after it has been published within the body of the post by clearly identifying it as so. eg. "Update : Added the following after discovering additional information subsequently."
